# DEEP_LEARNING_REAL_ESTATE


In this hands-on guided project, we will predict real estate prices with deep learning. In this project, we will predict home sale prices in King County in the U.S. between May, 2014 and May, 2015 using several features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, view, and square footage. This guided project is practical and directly applicable to the real estate industry.
